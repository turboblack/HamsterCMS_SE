            not-WYSIWYG but WYMIWYG â€” manual HTML code editing<BR>
            (What You Mean Is What You Get)<BR>
            why? so that it would work in IE5 (Internet Explorer 5 and possibly under 4) and in MS DOS<BR>
            code purity, no auto-generated garbage<BR>
            this is an editor for a "hamster", maximally simple and clear<BR>
            the interface is made with the expectation of compatibility with a very old IE<BR>
            everything else is compatible with the previous "hamster" HamsterCMS<BR>
            you will only need to replace one file (admin panel)<BR>
            p.s.: for the release I am making a template for this version (on tables, so that it would work in browsers of that era, in the same canon)<BR>
            below is the appearance of the editor for IE5<BR><BR>
